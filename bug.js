This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a dependency on a native module that is not properly configured for the Expo environment. It often happens when attempting to build the app for Android or iOS.  The exact error message may vary, but it usually involves issues with linking, missing native dependencies, or incompatibility between the native module and Expo's build system. For example:
```
Unable to resolve module `react-native-xyz` from `path/to/your/file.js`
```
This means your project needs the `react-native-xyz` module, but Expo can't find it or the module isn't compatible with the Expo managed workflow.  Another common symptom is an error during the build process related to missing Android or iOS native code.
